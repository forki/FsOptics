This is an experimental optics library for F# and is very much
*work-in-progress*.  The main question is whether a kind of
[encoding of van Laarhoven style lenses](https://gist.github.com/polytypic/b3bda0be1e1260e68959d5ffd612639d)
could lead to a *practical* optics library for F#.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/polytypic/FsOptics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/polytypic/FsOptics)

Here is a Bash script to get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/polytypic/FsOptics.git
cd FsOptics
./play.sh
```

After a moment of processing, you should be in F# interactive and ready to play.
